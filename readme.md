# Ramsey Algorithms

Here are a collection of algorithms written in Python in order to find the lower bound of diagonal Ramsey numbers. We define a Ramsey number v = R(m, n) to be the minimum number of vertices such that all 
graphs of order at least v will have either a clique of size m or an independent set of size n.
