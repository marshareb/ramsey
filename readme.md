# Ramsey Algorithms

Here are a collection of algorithms written in Python in order to find the lower bound of diagonal Ramsey numbers. We define a Ramsey number v = R(m, n) to be the minimum number of vertices such that all 
graphs of order at least v will have either a clique of size m or an independent set of size n. A diagonal Ramsey number is is the Ramsey number for R(m,m), which will be abbreviated to R(m). Currently, we have
that the lower bound for R(5) is 43. We would like to use these methods to improve this from 43 to 44.
